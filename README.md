Salary Disparities Between Men and Women
Project Overview---

This project aims to analyze salary disparities between men and women across various factors such as base pay, bonuses, education, seniority, and department distribution. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study uncovers significant patterns of pay inequality, providing insights into the underlying causes of the gender pay gap.


Key Insights---
>Men earn $4800 more on average in total salaries compared to women.
>Women earn $4776 less than men in base pay and $26 less in bonuses.
>Women are paid less even with similar education, seniority, and performance evaluations as their male counterparts.
>The proportion of men is higher in certain departments, especially engineering, contributing to the overall salary gap.
>Women tend to pursue higher degrees, potentially in pursuit of better remuneration, but the pay gap persists despite this.
